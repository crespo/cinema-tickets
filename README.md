# cinema-tickets
This program was made in 2019 for the conclusion of the class 'Introduction to Programming'. It's OOP based.

## Info
It stores all the informations at a .txt file, sells tickets, return tickets, have a sales summary, verifies previous sessions (looks for the .txt file) and do the room the size dynamically (if it's a new session, the program asks for the X and Y size of the room).

Since it's my first OOP project, I had trouble to understand how private and public variables works and how to work with them. But with some practice I get to understand it and finished the project.

## Testing it
1. Create a new Replit Python project [here](https://replit.com/new/python3). You have to create an account or login if you already have one.
1. Copy the [main.py](https://github.com/crespo/half-minesweeper/blob/master/game.c) code and paste it at the Replit editor.
1. Click on 'Run' that's sitting at the top of the browser.
